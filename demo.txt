hybrid framework - data driven framework + pytest framework
design pattern - POM(page object model)

structure of the framework
--------------------------
1. source_code/src/pom/pages (package)
2. tests (package)
3. utilities (package)
4. file library (package)
5. reports (package)
6. requirements.txt - names of all the pluggins

2. generating reports
    -> pip install pytest-html
    -> pytest test_file.py -vs --html="reportname.html"    #stores in current directory
    -> pytest test_file.py -vs --html="path(C:\Users\saral\PycharmProjects\framework_demo_new\reports)\reportname.html"

(to import file from one folder to another --init--.py package shd be thr complesory and its inbuilt file in python package)
python packages - __init__.py file is present
                - should be created to store python file
directory - normal folder without any init file
          - can be created for storing any files other than .py files

 src- source code & test are used for working flatform
